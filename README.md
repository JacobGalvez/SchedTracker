<h1>Routine Builder - Assistive Technology for the Neurodivergent</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

- This Task Tracker application is designed with a special focus on aiding the autistic community. The program leverages proven techniques of setting time limits to improve task completion rates. By combining structured directives with real-time task tracking, it empowers parents and caregivers to guide and support autistic children in developing skills and achieving daily goals.

- The program also includes features for tracking performance metrics, enabling parents to monitor their child’s progress over time. With this insight, parents can adapt their strategies to suit the child’s needs, such as introducing rewards to boost motivation on slower days.

<h3>Features</h3>

<h4>1. Task Management</h4>

- Create and Save Tasks: Parents can create tasks, set time limits, and track how long it takes to complete them.

- Task Completion Metrics: Automatically records how much time was allotted and the time taken to complete the task.

<h4>2. Time Tracking</h4>

- Real-Time Timer: A countdown timer helps the child stay focused by visually displaying the time remaining.

- Alerts and Audio Cues: When the timer ends, an alert and audio signal notify the child.

<h4>3. User Management</h4>

- Parent and Child Accounts: Supports user accounts for parents to manage tasks and track progress for one or more children.

- Task Assignment: Assign specific tasks to individual children.

<h4>4. Progress Metrics</h4>

- Daily Metrics: View how quickly tasks are completed on a day-to-day basis.

- Performance Insights: Analyze trends to identify good days and days where additional support or rewards may be beneficial.

<h3>Future Enhancements</h3>

- <b>Reward System:</b> Introduce a points-based system to incentivize task completion.

- <b>Enhanced Analytics:</b> Provide graphical insights into task performance and trends.

- <b>Mobile Support:</b> Develop a mobile-friendly version for on-the-go tracking.

- <b>Custom Alerts:</b> Allow parents to customize audio and visual alerts to suit their child’s preferences.

- <b>Themes:</b> To increase accessibility SchedTracker will come out of the box with a colorblind accessible color theme, we still want it to be interactive and customisable in a way that the user would like.
